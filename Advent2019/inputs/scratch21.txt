// FOR CLEARING
J = NOT T

// T is true if there are no holes

T = C AND T

OR A T

// T signifies if there is a hole in first 3
T = NOT T

// J is true if we have a hole at D

J = E OR J
J = H OR J

OR E J
OR H J

Set both to false
NOT T J
AND J T
AND T J

T = true if there a hole in first 3
OR A T
AND B T
AND C T // At this point T is false if theres a hole
NOT T T

J = true if theres solid ground in at least 1 of E or H
OR E J
OR H J

Merge the results into J
AND T J

Make sure theres room at D
