# Context

Advent of Code 2018 - all in **Kotlin** 

This is one of the **hardest years** of Advent of Code. In my opinion 2018 is more fair & straightforward than 2019 which had lots of math/insights/Intcode. 2018's difficulty was high across the board with fewer easier problems early in the month as well as many problems with lots of code like 15, 17, 24.

# Notable Problems
- 4: Extremely **tedious** log processing and datetime manipulation
- 6: Closest points counting, interesting to think about when the boundaries go infinite
- 8: Depth-sum style recursion - could be done via a stack
- 10: Similar to a 2024 problem but easier - letting coordinates fly until they join to an image
- 11: Should have used a [summed area table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table)
- 15, 24: Difficult **battle simulators**, first in a graph and second according to stats rules. Lots of custom Comparators.
- 16: Intcode but with operators hidden
- 17: Falling water simulator extreme. One of the best **Advent problems of all time**
- 20: Building a graph via a parenthesis-stack approach. The **hardest** problem of this year for me.
- 22: Classic complicated-state BFS
- 23: Had to learn **java-smt** to solve this insane problem without Octree search
