a = 1
b = 108100
c = 125100
f = 1 --- start
d = 2
e = 2 ------ 2


if d * e - b isnt 0 ------ 1, 3
f = 0
e += 1 ------- 3
if e - b isnt zero ------ 1

Essentially we increment e up to b
f is eventually zeroed when d * e = b which only occurs
when b is a multiple of d


d += 1
if d - b isnt zero ------2

increment d up to b


if f isnt zero -----4
h -= 1
if b - c isnt zero ----- 4, 5
programs done
b -= 17 ----- 5
always go back to start --- start
