- 15: Pushing boxes in a grid - my **favorite problem** of the year
- 16: Modifying Dijkstra to return all possible previous nodes in a among all shortest paths
- 17: Hand disassembly + reverse engineering using complicated bitwise logic - highly **difficult**
- 21: Hard to understand recursion - **most difficult** problem of the year
